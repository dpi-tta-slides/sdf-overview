# Asking Questions

- This course is **question-driven**.
- We need you to ask questions.
- Speak up whenever you feel like it, or raise your hand.
- If you're not sure whether it's relevant to everyone, wave over a TA and ask them; they'll decide and escalate.
- Outside of class, our rule: You're only allowed to get stuck for **15 minutes** before asking a question.
- We'll be available in the classroom, calendly, Discord, and Ask.

# Asking Questions

- The course is organized according to the the lock-before-key principle 🔐
- I won't provide the info needed to solve an exercise until someone asks the question.

# What does it mean to "know how to code"?

"**Knowing how to hack** also means that **when you have ideas, you'll be able to implement them**.... It's a big advantage, when you're considering an idea like putting a college facebook online, if instead of merely thinking 'That’s an interesting idea,' you can think instead '**That’s an interesting idea. I’ll try building an initial version tonight.**"

— Paul Graham, "[How to Get Startup Ideas](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)"

# Learning how to learn
- Our real goal during these 12 weeks is not to learn Ruby, Rails, Bootstrap, or any other particular language or framework.
- These are good, beginner-friendly, motivating choices for an introductory course.
- Our real goal is to **learn how to learn**, so that you can then go on to learn whatever interests you.

---

# Learning how to learn
- Being a software developer means being a **lifelong learner**.
- There are always new languages, techniques, and frameworks to stay up-to-date on.
- Every single project involves learning new things, depending on what real-world problem you're being hired to solve.
- **We are inventors**. There are no formulas to look up and apply; we have to learn about the problem and then invent solutions.

# Sounds good, but who are you?
- Hi! I'm Ian
- Back in 2012 I was living in Shenzhen, China teaching English
- I wanted to to learn "how to code".
- Specifically, I wanted to build an iOS app — but I didn't know anyone who knew how or what to learn to get there.

"That’s exactly the thing that will turn people away from programming forever,” he said. “It’s like teaching someone chemistry as the first thing if they want to learn how to paint."

— Raghu Betina, on teaching CS to people who want to learn application development

# How the course will work
- Learning how to program from lectures is really hard.
- So many things to juggle:
    - watching me
    - typing along
    - taking notes
    - etc.
- Super easy to fall behind if you get stuck on something.

---
# How the course will work
- We'll be using a "flipped" format.
- Instead of lectures, you'll have videos that you can pause, speed up, skip back, search, and reference whenever you want.
- During our class meetings, we'll do activities together to practice and reinforce what you learned from the videos and readings.

---
# Schedule
- "Check-in" - 9
- "Stand-ups" - 9:15
- "class meetings" - M/W/R at 1
- "lab" - all the remaining time
    - (with the exception of other seminars and guest lectures).
<!-- There will be exceptions, but that's the general plan. -->

---
# Canvas
- Canvas is our home base.
- I recommend always clicking "Modules"
- Try to complete all required assignments by the due date

---

# Getting started
- You should start your first modules: **Getting Started** and **Week 1: Assignments**
- During lab time, the teaching assistants and instructors will be available for questions.
- Please walk over and ask us lots of questions as you're working through the videos, readings, and projects.
               
---

# What if I finish?
- If you finish the required assignments, you should:
  - Try doing assignments again if you're feeling shaky. It should be easier the second time. Take notes on what's still confusing so we can discuss it during class.
  - Try the optional assignments to extend your learning if you're feeling very good about the required assignments.
  - Try applying the concepts you've learned to your own ideas. (**Best possible way to learn**)
  - Some students have reported watching the videos over again at 2x speed is helpful.

# Course Outline (technical)
- 6 weeks assignments with deadlines
- 6 weeks building your own projects
